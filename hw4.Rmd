For our implementation, we chose to go with the following discrete distributions to deterimine the probability that n is the total number of socks we have in the washer.    
`Poisson`     
`Negative Binomial`     
We need discrete distributions, because looking at the scenario we are dealing with, it's highly unlikely that we are going to have a fraction of a sock. A Poisson distribution has one parameter, p.  p tells us the possibility of success within each trial. The probability that we have n socks in the washer is p. A Negative Binomial distribution has two parameters, p and r. p tells us the possibility of success within each trial and r is the number of successes accumulated. So say we have a laundry basket with a variety of clothes, shirts, pants, socks, etc. p is the possibility that an article of clothing inside the laundry basket is a sock. r is the total number of socks inside the laundry basket.     
        
To describe the proportion of socks that are part of pair within the total number of socks in the washer, we use the following continuous distributions. 
`Beta`     
`Truncated Normal`    
`Uniform`    
We can use continuous distributions in this case, because we are calculating the proportion - so x% of our socks have a corresponding pair. Note this doesn't tell us the number of pairs we have, but paired socks. For example, we have 4 sock pairs, but 8 paired socks. A Beta distribution has to parameters, a and b. These are referred to as shape parameters. The probability that our proportion is x among a + b - 2 trials is a - 1. For a Truncated Normal distribution, we have two parameters, mean and standard deviation, a lower bound, and an upper bound. Our proportion, x, is very likely to be the mean. It becomes less and less likely as we move away from the mean and the rate at which the probability decreases is determined by the standard deviation. For a Trunated Normal distribution, our proportion x is bounded between two numbers. A Uniform Distribution tells us that our proportion x is equally likely to be any number. We added this distribution, since we don't know how many people are contribution socks to the laundry. It might be better to play it safe and consider everything to be equally likely. One thing to note is that our proportion x has to be between 0 and 1. It's impossible to have 1.5 of our total n socks be a paired sock.
