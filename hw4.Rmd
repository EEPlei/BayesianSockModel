For our implementation, we chose to go with the following discrete distributions to deterimine the probability that n is the total number of socks we have in the washer.    
`Poisson`     
`Negative Binomial`     
We need discrete distributions, because looking at the scenario we are dealing with, it's highly unlikely that we are going to have a fraction of a sock. A Poisson distribution has one parameter, p.  p tells us the possibility of success within each trial. The probability that we have n socks in the washer is p. A Negative Binomial distribution has two parameters, p and r. p tells us the possibility of success within each trial and r is the number of successes accumulated. So say we have a laundry basket with a variety of clothes, shirts, pants, socks, etc. p is the possibility that an article of clothing inside the laundry basket is a sock. r is the total number of socks inside the laundry basket.     
        
To describe the proportion of socks that are part of pair within the total number of socks in the washer, we use the following continuous distributions. 
`Beta`     
`Truncated Normal`    
`Uniform`    
We can use continuous distributions in this case, because we are calculating the proportion - so x% of our socks have a corresponding pair. Note this doesn't tell us the number of pairs we have, but paired socks. For example, we have 4 sock pairs, but 8 paired socks.
